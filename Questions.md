1. Should token launch submission be opened to anyone, or there should be some requirement, like holding x amount of curation token, or redemption time on wallet.

2. Should the system allow multiple token launch submission simultaneously, or a queue based, so it streamlines the voting process. Maybe there should be additional parameter for voting period.

3. Should the factory be upgradable, or should this only apply to specific instances? My assumption is that curator instances would have a limited lifetime tied to their launches, so upgrades might be unnecessary for them, but the Factory could benefit from upgradability if changes are anticipated.

4. Should stake duration be global for all launches or be configurable per each launch i.e additional parameter.

5. Which Uniswap version the smart contract should integrate with.

6. How we would mark the launches complete? I think we should have some status for it.

7. Should registry store the past launches or focus only on the pending ones.

- should the New Tokens be send at Curtaion contract creation or i.e use approval to distirbute New Tokens when amount of staking tokens is sufficient
- what sould be the price at Uniswap pool? Should it just be ratio based? Who should receive the LP token.
- unstake and stake should be blocked as far as sufficient amount of tokens are staked
- the New Tokens are distributed to stakers but there also needs to be tokens for Liquidity, how should this work
