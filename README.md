## About

### Design

I have chosen the clone pattern (minimal proxies) for efficient deployment. That makes sense because creating multiple instances of similar contracts can save gas. The use of upgradeable contracts via Initializable and OwnableUpgradeable suggests they wanted the ability to update the factory or curation logic without redeploying, which is a common practice for managing upgrades.
